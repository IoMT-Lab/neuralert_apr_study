Zune
=====

This example bug scenario comes from the GenProg TSE 2012 benchmarks,
and is based on the infamous Microsoft Zune leap year bug.
Note that, without certain preprocessing transformations that were
automatically and necessarily performed by the original GenProg as a
result of its interaction with CIL, a fix for this program cannot be
found by using GenProg's statement level operators on the orignal
source code.
